My chum asked three times for a mani stone and I've had one ready for a while.

Redcliffe bay looking towards Battery Point. This is where I found this gorgeous stone. 

It is made of [Upper Old Red Sandstone](http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Upper_Old_Red_Sandstone,_Bristol_and_Gloucester_region).

All cleaned and prepared with the tools sharpened. The hammer is still the one I got in Ladakh from the yogins.

I chose this one because of how beautifully flat it is and its colours and diagonal grain.
