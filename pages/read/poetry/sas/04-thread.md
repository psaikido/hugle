<div class="poem">
The moon is just the moon,   
I cry out to it, reach the top of my ladder,   
and crash down,   
as I must.   
  
Windmills are just windmills,   
stiving to get to them,   
to get away from where I am,   
heather like the squiggles of brain tissue,   
I sink into my predicament,   
am I going to drown?   
  
Home is just home,   
and misery lolls in my chest,   
much ventured and nothing gained,   
stuck between worlds,   
and yet,   
  
a hint of spider's thread,   
  
tender silence,   
  
holds me up.
