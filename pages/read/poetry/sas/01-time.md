<div class="poem">
It's the untie-able knot,  
The untouchable knot that never stops tying.  
It never stops, no-one can stop it.  
Once something is done,  
It's there forever.  
No-one goes back.  
What's there behind now is there forever,  
Forever more, that's the knot.  
No-one can go forwards,  
In front of time,  
No-one can go backwards,  
Behind time.  
Time just never stops ticking by. . .
