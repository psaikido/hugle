<div class="poem">
ah, the glory of that bicycle  
is it so long ago  
that birthday?  
  
wheeling scared elated  
entrusted to momentum  
my Dad released me  
laughing steps receding  
down our little hill  
  
wind thrilled  
my boyhood ablaze  
with love mutely given  
and tacitly received  
</div>
