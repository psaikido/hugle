I tried to buy 'hughtube.com' but someone had already taken it. Mighty surprised to find that 'hugle.co.uk' was not, so of course I grabbed it. It was years later that I started doing professional magic gigs and thought to use the domain for it. Ill-health put an end to it, but for a few years it was tremendous fun. Less formally, I did many hundreds of shows and especially enjoyed doing tricks for folks in India and China on various Buddhist pilgrimages I was lucky enough to go on. It is a great way to break through a language barrier.
