<div class="poem">
I'd been asked  
to talk on Chan  
at the Ashmolean  
there was a caligrapher there  
Bing Nan Li  
he had no English  


a group milled about  
I decided to begin  
and called their attention  
with a bell  
and chanting  


when I sang  
the ancient tunes  
the three refuges  
the four great vows  
the traditional Chinese  
he came close and sat  
I sensed his emotion  
in his demeanour  


after my talk  
a noise  
about silence  
the translator  
came to tell me  
the man had decided  
to give me a scroll  
the Heart Sutra  
she was  
consternated  
saying the artifact  
was precious  


not feeling worthy  
I put that aside  
and accepted  
whatever the gesture meant  
to him  
was a mystery  
not to be  
evaluated
