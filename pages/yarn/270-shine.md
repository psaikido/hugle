<div class="poem">
dreaming of my grandma  
and mam  
baking in the kitchen  


I asked where brother number 4 was  
"he's taking number 2 swimming"  
said my mam  


"but how can the younger one  
take the older one?"  
I asked  


"haven't you heard?  
the families turned  
upside down  
now the younger  
looks after the older"  


"but I'm the youngest  
how can I look after  
everyone?"  


grandma looks up  
and says  
"all you have to do  


is shine!"
