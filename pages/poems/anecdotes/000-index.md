As a deliberate attempt to cheer myself up I've written about important moments, curious incidents and so forth.  
They didn't always cheer me up, but it is fun writing in this prose/poem style I reckons.  
Often these stories have lain around for decades and when the time comes to write them, they just leap out.


100% true in all details afaik! Let me know if exageration has crept in.
