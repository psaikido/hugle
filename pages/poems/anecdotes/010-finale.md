<div class="poem">
street juggling finale  
looking straight up  
throwing those balls so high  
I didn't see the kid  
romper suit  
reins trailing  
wobble out of the crowd  
and punch me

right in the doodads

as I hit the floor  
the demon returned  
to its parents  
as my juggling things  
landed on me  
and I tried  
not to be sick

it was the biggest laugh  
I ever got
</div>
