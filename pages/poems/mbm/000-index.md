Poems from a pilgrimage to Ladakh, India and Thailand.  

In 2005 I went on a journey of the heart. My then wife had run off so I thought why the hell not go and see the big four main pilgrimage sites of Buddhism - where the Buddha was born, realised enlightenment, started teaching and died.

I started by going to Ladakh though. My teacher, the late, great John Crook, had spent a lot of time there and I had a deep love all Tibetan Buddhism. I hoped to find something of lasting value, something truly beautiful and maybe, something to heal my wounds.
