title: don't freak out

<div class="poem">
don't freak out  
when Hughie is freaking out  
Chang Ke says:  
ruminating on hurts of the past  
only hurts you in the present  
it's usually pain and tiredness  
that really needs attending to  
so stop trying to fix it  
stop trying to figure it out  
stop trying  
remember  
your heart is both good and true  
and made up of everything  
and everyone else  
so practice is for all of us  
the universe wants you  
or you wouldn't be here  
your honour is redeemed  
pain is not failure  
it's the fare for the ferryman  
to bring you back across  
just what Mother Nature needs  
in return for your life  
so have a rest  
then take the backward step  
love cannot arrive from outside  
we must return  
in silent appreciation  
to this present moment  
just being itself  
and sit still  
in the heart  
with all suffering beings  
have faith and surrender  
to the surrounding hush  
so bright  
with loving
</div>
