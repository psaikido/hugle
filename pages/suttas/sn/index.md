The Connected Discourses

This is my selection and a few notes on the Suttas I found interesting with links to the full text.

Each entry starts with a title 'SN 1.1.1 Pali name, English name'. The numbering system is based on Bhikku Bodhi's two part translations. The first number is the book, the second the chapter, the third the verse. So, for example, the first one is 'SN 1.1.1 Ogha-tarana Sutta: Crossing the Flood' meaning Samyutta Nikaya book 1, chapter 1, verse 1'.
