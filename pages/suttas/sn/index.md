The Connected Discourses

![The Connected Length Discourses](/assets/images/chan/samyutta.jpg)

This is my selection and a few notes on the Suttas I found interesting with links to the full text.

Each entry starts with a title 'SN 1.1.1 Pali name, English name'. The numbering system is based on Bhikku Bodhi's translations. They come in two volumes each of which contains 'books'. The first three books are in the first volume. The first number given is the book, the second the chapter, the third the verse. So, for example, the first one is 'SN 1.1.1 Ogha-tarana Sutta: Crossing the Flood' meaning Samyutta Nikaya book 1, chapter 1, verse 1'.
