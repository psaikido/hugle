title: "MN 122 Greater Discourse on Voidness: Maha-sunnyata"
---

The Buddha finds Ananda living with a lot of monks. 'Ananada, 
a bikkhu does not shine by taking delight in company'. One who 
does so can't attain the bliss of renunciation, seclusion, peace 
or enlightenment.  


'I do not see even a single form, Ananda, from the change 
and alteration of which there would not arise sorrow [...] 
and despair in one who lusts for it and takes delight in it.'


'However, Ananda, there is this abiding discovered by the 
Tathagata: to enter and abide in voidness internally by giving 
no attention to all signs'.


A teacher a student and one leading the holy life can all 
be undone by taking delight in company. They revert to luxury and 
succumb to craving.
