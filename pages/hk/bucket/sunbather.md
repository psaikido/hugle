I've always felt  
colourless  
skin so very pale  
sunburned  
in moments  


careful with the timing  
I sunbathed  
maybe it would make me  
more attractive  
maybe Eros  
would smile upon me  
once again  


little hairs  
on my arm  
spectacular spectra  
rainbows refracting  
scintillating  
amethyst  
sapphire  
ruby  
emerald


it reminded me  
about how we are all  
preposterous jewels  
awkward miracles
