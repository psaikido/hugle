<div class="poem">
through the heat shimmer  
of the pyres of Varanasi  
a boat  
a tiny shroud  
stone weighted  
sinks
 
the mother's hand  
touches the Ganga waters  
wet but empty  
 
flames purify  
those who cross over  
flesh blackening  
melting
 
the elements return  
to Mother Nature  
from whom  
they never really left
</div>
