<div class="poem">
my biggest brother  
astride the Himalayas!  
alone in a boat  
on an ocean!  
naming a glacier!  
in Antarctica!  


as a kid  
the only person  
more heroic  
more impressive  
was Neil Armstrong!  


I used to think  
you didn't know who I was  
so thank you  
for taking the trouble  
to change my mind
