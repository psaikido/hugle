Poems on circus, zen, love, longing, loss and darkness.  
Most have sprung from the silence of meditation.  
I rarely write in a deliberate way but instead wait until something comes up demanding to be written.  
The poems from 'Ladakh' onwards are from a pilgrimage in 2005/6. The writings in prose form about that journey are called [Mahabodhi Moonlight](/pages/prose/mahabodhi-moonlight.html)
