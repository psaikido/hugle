<div class="poem">
over my shoulder looking  
I saw the river gliding  
water so quiet  
sunlight all dancing  
under leaves shimmering  
ripple scintillating  
but so so quiet  
the water streaming  
insides resonating  
with that silence  
why would it bring tears?  
the shortening days?  
looking for spring-time's jumper?  
knowing I'm just visiting?  
gliding by?
