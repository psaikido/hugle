Inner journeys from the 90s.  
The first one [time](/pages/poems/sas/01-time.html) is an exception though.  
It was from school when I was around 9.  
The wondrous Mr Nolan asked us to listen  
in silence for a few minutes and then write a poem.  
My mam carried it around in her wallet  
for years she says.
