#### preface
Taking the 'backward step' in zazen I often find that the unconscious gets to work. Moments significant to me arrange themselves into a haiku/haibun/senryu sort of form, dubbed 'hughku' (thanks Brendan!). Making them public is taking the 'forward step' of full self-expression, a concept much appreciated from Roshi Reb Anderson.


Few people know how long they have here. That fact made me want to document these anecdotes. Here they are in roughly chronological order.


100% true in all details afaik! Let me know if exageration has crept in - email is in the footer below.


#### back cover blurb
_Hugh Carroll is a magician. A magician of thoughts, of music, of
meditation, of empathy and kinship, but here and now, he is a
magician of words. These poems are some of his grandest tricks yet.
Through honest and incisive prose that seems part Rumi, part diary
but all Hughie, we share memories and lucid visions of his vibrant and
emotional past._


_This is a poetic diarist detailing his heart and soul but his style is just
so inviting and humble that it's hard not to share the feelings behind every experience he documents._


_Once you have read these works, you will know Hugh. If you already
know him, then you’ll know him better. Regardless, many poets never
achieve the directness or elegance shown here. This is a vital and
compelling read. Magical, in fact._


_– Brendan Hamley_
