<div class="poem">
the scars were deep  
all over his face  
car windscreen maybe?  
we sat down  
shook hands  
arranged the pieces  
set the clock  
and began  
the cut  
and thrust  
gradually  
the nerves subsided  
and eventually  
I set a trap  
a pawn as bait  
to tempt his queen  
once in  
she was doomed  
in three moves  
at most  
the permutations  
branched out  
like broccoli  
at the end  
each flower  
was death  
I checked it  
over and over  
and made my move  
heart in mouth  
attention shifted  
to him  
his eyes brightened  
noticing  
his prey  
his spirits lifted  
as he thought it  
undefended  
I could read his mind  
on his battered face  
feel his joy rising  
as he reached out  
and took it  
over the next few moves  
the reality dawned  
his features crumbled  
his demeanour sank  
his life  
drained out  
my guilt  
lacerating  
taking his queen  
another cut
