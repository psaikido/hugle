For terminology see [rotation codes](/pages/kites/rotation-codes.html)

On completion of the first 8 levels you are awarded the title of 'Master'. After the following 'master' levels, from 9 to 14, the title is 'Double Master'. The final level 14 has to be created by yourself. Doing all levels with a 'speed series' kite leads to the 'Triple Master' award.
