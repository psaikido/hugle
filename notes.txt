For svg editing, use inkscape, make the document settings
the same dimensions and view box as the wind-window (800 x 400),
and save the file. Go to https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/
and upload it. Copy the svg path out of the 'markup' tab.
Paste that path into patterns.html and give it an id.
